Welcome to the Modrinth docs! This site aims to provide you as much information as possible about Modrinth's projects.

The docs are divided into the [Labrinth (API) docs](/api), which provides information about the API, which endpoints are aviable, endpoint query params, responses data shape and status codes if you want to implement Modrinth API in your code
and the [Contributing guide](/contributing/overview), which provides information on how to set up Modrinth's monorepo on you machine if you would like to contribute to it and in depth information about each project.
