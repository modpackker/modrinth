Welcome to the Modrinth docs! This site aims to provide you as much information as possible about Modrinth's projects.

The docs are divided into the [API spec](/api) and the [Contributing guide](/contributing/overview).

The API docs provide information about the Modrinth API: which endpoints are aviable, endpoint specific query params, the response data shape and status codes if you want to implement Modrinth API in your code.

The contributing guide provides information on how to set up Modrinth's monorepo on your machine if you would like to contribute to it and in depth information about each project.
