import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[Knossos](https://modrinth.com) is Modrinth's [website](https://modrinth.com) frontend built using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) a framework for building [Vue](https://vuejs.org) applications and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

The codebase is kept in Modrinth's [monorepo](https://github.com/modrinth/code). You can find it in the [/apps/frontend](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/apps/frontend) directory.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Follow [Getting started](/contributing/getting-started#installation) guide

2. Start the development server from the root of the monorepo by running
    ```bash
    pnpm run web:dev
    ```
    
    or inside the directory after running the respective build scripts for `@modrinth/assets`, `@modrinth/ui` and `@modrinth/utils` which Knossos use as internal packages
    
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

3. Open you browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

</Steps>

Nuxt supports hot-reloading: any changes you make to the code will automatically shown in the browser.

You can compile the project to test a production server by running `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run preview` to open it in the browser.

You can also use `pnpm run lint` to find any eslint problems, and `pnpm run fix` to try automatically fixing them.
