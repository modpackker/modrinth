The codebase is kept at [Minotaur](https://github.com/modrinth/minotaur).

<Steps>

1. Publish it to your local Maven with `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` and add `mavenLocal()` to your buildscript.

Minotaur contains two test environments within it - one with [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle) and one with [Fabric Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom), you may want to tweak these environments.
