Modrinth Docs is the site you are looking at right now. It's here to help us work with Modrinth's projects and provide various information.

The Docs are built using [Astro](https://astro.build) a content focused framework and the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) theme specifically designed for documentation sites.

The codebase is kept in Modrinth's [monorepo](https://github.com/modrinth/code). You can find it in the [`/apps/docs`](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/apps/docs) directory.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Follow [Getting started](/contributing/getting-started#installation) guide

2. Start the development server from the root of the monorepo by running
    ```bash
    pnpm run docs:dev
    ```
    
    or inside the docs directory, as it doesn't rely on any internal package to be built, by running
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

</Steps>

Pages are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and are stored in the `/src/content/docs` directory.
The [API spec](/api) is auto generated with [starlight-openapi](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-openapi) from the `/public/openapi.yaml` file.
