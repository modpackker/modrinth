[Daedalus](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/packages/daedalus) is a library providing model structs and methods for requesting and parsing things from Minecraft and other mod loaders meta APIs.

The codebase is kept in Modrinth's [monorepo](https://github.com/modrinth/code).

## Architecture

Daedalus is split up into two parts:

- [`packages/daedalus`](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/apps/daedalus_client): The library holding all the core logic for the service
- [`apps/daedalus_client`](https://github.com/modrinth/code/tree/main/apps/daedalus_client): The service worker that runs in the background and handles requests
